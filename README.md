[Click here](https://oxism.com/oriDomi) for examples, documentation and notes.

Read the [annotated source](https://oxism.com/oriDomi/docs/oridomi.html) for a
detailed look.

If you want to work on the source, run `npm install` after first cloning to
install local package dependencies.

Run `cake watch` to automatically compile as you work.

`cake build` will update the annotated source and the minified version as well.

Pull requests are welcome. When contributing, please commit just the `.coffee`
file and I'll update the build when it's merged.

The DOM is your oyster.

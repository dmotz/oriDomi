# Defaults
# ========

# These defaults are used by all OriDomi instances unless overridden.
defaults =
  # The number of vertical panels (for folding left or right).
  # You can use either an integer, or an array of percentages if you want custom
  # panel widths, e.g. `[20, 10, 10, 20, 10, 20, 10]`.
  # The numbers must add up to 100 (or near it, so you can use values like
  # `[33, 33, 33]`).
  vPanels: 3
  # The number of horizontal panels (for folding top or bottom) or an array of percentages.
  hPanels: 3
  # The determines the distance in pixels (z axis) of the camera/viewer to the paper.
  # The smaller the value, the more distorted and exaggerated the effects will appear.
  perspective: 1000
  # The default shading style is hard, which shows distinct creases in the paper.
  # Other options include `'soft'` -- for a smoother, more rounded look -- or `false`
  # to disable shading altogether for a flat look.
  shading: 'hard'
  # Determines the duration of all animations in milliseconds.
  speed: 700
  # Configurable maximum angle for effects. With most effects, exceeding 90/-90 usually
  # makes the element wrap around and pass through itself leading to some glitchy visuals.
  maxAngle: 90
  # Ripple mode causes effects to fold in a staggered, cascading manner.
  # `1` indicates a forward cascade, `2` is backwards. It is disabled by default.
  ripple: 0
  # This CSS class is applied to OriDomi elements so they can be easily targeted later.
  oriDomiClass: libName.toLowerCase()
  # This is a multiplier that determines the darkness of shading.
  # If you need subtler shading, set this to a value below 1.
  shadingIntensity: 1
  # This option allows you to supply the name of a CSS easing method or a
  # cubic bezier formula for customized animation easing.
  easingMethod: ''
  # Number of pixels to offset each panel to prevent small gaps from appearing
  # between them. This is configurable if you have a need for precision.
  gapNudge: 1.5
  # Allows the user to fold the element via touch or mouse.
  touchEnabled: true
  # Coefficient of touch/drag action's distance delta. Higher numbers cause more movement.
  touchSensitivity: .25
  # Custom callbacks for touch/drag events. Each one is invoked with a relevant
  # value so they can be used to manipulate objects outside of the OriDomi
  # instance (e.g. sliding panels). x values are returned when folding left and
  # right, y values for top and bottom. The second argument passed is the original
  # touch or mouse event. These are empty functions by default. Invoked with
  # starting coordinate as first argument.

  # Convenience Methods
  # ===================


  # Resets all panels back to zero degrees.
  reset: (callback) ->

  # Simply proxy for calling `accordion` with `sticky` enabled.
  # Keeps first panel flat on page.

    @accordion angle, anchor, options


  # Proxy to enable stairs mode on `accordion`.
  stairs: (angle, anchor, options = {}) ->
    options.stairs = options.sticky = true
    @accordion angle, anchor, options


  # The composition is split apart by its panels rather than folded.
  fracture: (angle, anchor, options = {}) ->
    options.fracture = true
    @accordion angle, anchor, options


  # Similar to `fracture`, but the panels are twisted as well.
  twist: (angle, anchor, options = {}) ->
    options.fracture = options.twist = true
    @accordion angle / 10, anchor, options


  # Convenience proxy to accordion-fold instance to maximum angle.
  collapse: (anchor, options = {}) ->
    options.sticky = false
    @accordion -@_config.maxAngle, anchor, options


  # Same as `collapse`, but uses positive angle for slightly different effect.
